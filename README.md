## Using the Hack:

### **Disclaimer: You will lose any data from the Game, as you will need to uninstall it (explanation in guide below). The only data that will be kept is the data synced to your Google play account, if you have it connected to Pixel Gun 3D. To note is that a sync to Google Play will only store Guns, and in most cases levels. Use this hack at your own Risk. It is possible to also lose the data stored to google play.**

#### Method 1: 
Without Google Play

This method will only give you free coins and gems.

1. Deinstall Pixel Gun 3D
    This step is only needed if you already have Pixel Gun 3D installed ony our device.
    It is neccesary to do so, as in android you can not easily install the same app two times.
    
2. Install the first APK File
    Install "PixelGun3D-Hack.apk"
    It should have a size of about 300 MB, and will take a while to install, so be patient.
    
3. Open "Pixel Gun 3D"
    Slight name variations possible.

4. Follow the on screen instructions
    After it has loaded, all you should need to do to is tap on the screen until you are in the Lobby.
    
5. Open Developer Options
    There should be a red button with a "D" on it visible on screen, near the top right.
    Click on this button.
    It should open a menu.
    
6. Change Setting in Developer Options
    The only setting to change are the boxes labeled "Coins" and "Gems".
    Change these to the amount of money to hack. 
    To note: the higher the amount of money, the more likely you are going to get banned by the anti-cheat
    My recommendation is about 30000 for each.
    From other sources i have heard that you can change it to up to 99999 before getting banned, but there is still a relatily large chance of getting banned.
    If you want to stay almost completely safe, stay below 20000.
    
7. Open a file explorer
    Open any file explorer, all will work for this.
    Navigate to -android path-/android/data/
    Rename "com.pixelgun name" to "com.pixelgun name1"
 
8. Uninstall "Pixel Gun 3D"
    Do NOT open the app after you renamed the folder, just uninstall it.
